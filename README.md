# Reinforcement-Rabbits

This was my project for school. It's using reinforcement learning from ML-Agents library. Game is written in Unity and has 3 play modes. First is only you playing, second is only watching a rabbit, third is you competing against a rabbit. Goal is collecting eggs. Rabbit can orient himself in space collect eggs.

Here are some screen shots from game:
