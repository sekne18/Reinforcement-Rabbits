# Reinforcement-Rabbits

Disclaimer!
This project was made for learning purposes only. The library is now outdated and has changed a lot since this version 0.10.0.

The game was made in Unity with the help of ML-Agents library. You can play three different modes. One is Solo play, second is watch the rabbit play alone and third mode is competing against the rabbit. Goal is collecting eggs. Rabbit can orient himself in space and collect eggs.

Here are some screenshots from the game:
